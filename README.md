# Version 1.5.0

Imagine a computer program that operates like the human mind, where hundreds,
thousands, even millions of cells work together to solve complex problems.
This concept is now possible using a new programming paradigm called
*Cellular Programming*.  With cellular programming, computational
tasks are performed by autonomous, distributed execution units working
in concert to process data.

*NeuPaths* is an API and runtime environment for Cellular Programming. It is written
in pure Java SE, making it possible to achieve “write once, run anywhere.”
The *NeuPaths* SDK provides a framework for massively parallel, distributed,
asynchronous processing modeled after the human nervous system.

The *NeuPaths* SDK is provided under the [CC BY 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/)
license as unrestricted fully-functional freeware that can be used privately,
academically and commercially.  It is provided as Java archives compiled under different
Java runtime versions: **neupaths_jre17.jar**, **neupaths_jre19.jar**, **neupaths_jre21.jar**
(see archives).  JARs can be provided for additional versions of the Java runtime if
needed.

To get started with *NeuPaths*, read the [Overview](documents/NeuPaths_Overview.pdf) and
[SDK User Guide](documents/NeuPaths_SDK_User_Guide.pdf) documents.  The
SDK documentation (see documents/javadoc) provides details on the
API classes and SDK utilities.  Download an archive of the latest version by
navigating to **Releases** and selecting the *.zip* or *.tar.gz* archive.
